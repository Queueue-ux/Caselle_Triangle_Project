Scenario 1:

	- reading user input from TextBox with Binding wasn't working
		- switched to calling the TextBox directly from code

Scenario 2:

	- output not generated instantly
		- added hook to backend function to all input fields

Scenario 3:

	- crashed on first input
		- changed to return when an empty input is found

	- produced error output before all inputs were entered
		- swapped order of error output and checking for empty inputs

Scenario 4:

	- calculation for Isosceles triangle not working
		- accidentally checked a == b twice
	- equilateral not working
		- Isosceles was checked first overriding equilater, made isoceles validation more specific by explicitly checking for 2 equal sides
	- can't produce a right isosceles triangle
		- now allow double input
	- double input not catching right isosceles
		- now round input

Scenario 5:
	
	- text message getting cut off
		- widened output field for frontend

Scenario 6:

	- return value for Math.Acos was radian
		- multiplied by 180/Math.PI to convert to degrees
